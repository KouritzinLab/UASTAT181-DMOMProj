This is a jupyter-notebook in which the code is written in python. The regions with the python code are called cells. To execute the piece of code, you can take the following paths: \n",

        "1. Hover over the cells and you will see a play button like such (⏵) on the left hand side of the cell. Clicking the play button will execute the cell. \n",

If the Bayes factor of the Guided Model is higher than that of the best of random models, the guided assumption is closer to the truth. You would notice that as you increase the number of hidden states, the Bayes Factor improves as well. Why do you think that is? \n",
